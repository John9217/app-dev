## My Favorite Film

Films are one of the best form of escapism that I have. Film opens a lot of things like worldview, politics, and societal situations that can peek to the curiosity of everyone. I personally have a lot of favorite films but the film that ranks the top among all of them is How to Train your Dragon. 

How to Train your Dragon is an animated film and franchise that was created by [DreamWorks Animation](https://www.dreamworks.com/) and directed by [Chris Sanders](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0761498/) and [Dean Deblois](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0213450/). It's a story of a young viking, Hiccup, who wants to prove himmself to his village and his father that he can fight and kill dragons. After catching the rare and legendary night fury, Toothless, he realizes that he actually has an affinity towards dragons. This film is a story of friendship, standing up to what is right, and allowing yourself towards a more progressive view. Here are the things that I love about this film and this franshise. 

- The Story Progression
  Throughout the franchise, it shows how friendships evolve. It shows how friendship can be found in the most unexpexted ways and realizing that sometimes, friendships can't be physically with us as we grow and mature. It also shows how can we depend on other people and how helpful it is to share the burdens that we are carying with the people around us. Lastly, the franchise is a story of maturity. The first film is about discovering the power of friendship, the second one is about taking on responsibility, and the third one is about learning to let go. These are the lessons that we learn throughout our maturity stage and I love how the franchise tells that.

- The Characters
  The franchise exhibits wondefully built characters. Not only the main characters but also most of the supporting characters have three dimensional personalities on them. It's also amazing how the characters have their dynamics towards each others. From slapstick humors to heartfelt scenes, this franchise can deliver all of these emotions through its characters.

- The Score
  A soundtrack has the ability of making a film stick or fall from the viewer's mind and heart. Regardless whether the film is actually good or bad, if it doesn't have a wonderful musical score, it'll always have that incomplete feeling about it. This franchise has a score that will surely send shivers down your spine and will take you to a trip down memory lane. Composed by the legendary composer, [John Powell](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0694173/), this franchise's musical score will deliver the emotions that the film wants you to feel. A great example for this is the song Test Drive. It is composed of both Hiccup and Toothless' theme as they try to fly. At the beginning, both of their theme are clashing against each other, making it sounds very messy and unsynchronized as you can also see on the screen. Once Hiccup realized that he has to use his heart instead of his mind, the score starts to become cohesive and fully turning into an orchestral masterpiece once Hiccup starts flying by instinct and completely in sync with Toothless.

These are just som of the examples of what I love about the How to Train your Dragon franchise. As someone who is during his teenage years when this franchise drops, I can fully relate to this relate to this franchise and grow and mature alongside it.
